# SpaceTraveller
This app was built during HackEd! My partner and I decided to build a fun little mini game.
This application uses java in the environment libGDX and is an android app where the user enters the game as a space shuttle, and must dodge the meteors in order to stay alive. We also allows users the ability to increase difficulty through tapping on the phone screen. With each tap the meteors move faster resulting in the difficulty increasing for staying alive.
